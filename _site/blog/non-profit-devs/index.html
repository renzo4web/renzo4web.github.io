<p>Hello, my name is Jenaro Calviño and I'm the founder of non profit devs.</p>
<h3>What is non profit devs?</h3>
<p>It is a place where developers/designers, can contribute
<em>ad honorem</em> to non profit organizations and/or where NGOs can ask for their projects to be carried out.</p>
<h3>Am I a good fit?</h3>
<p>Yes you are! We are not going to check your GitHub profile or your resume, in fact, the idea came to me at a time where I was a junior and thought a place like this would give me the opportunity to showcase my skills.</p>
<h3>Contributing</h3>
<p>If you like the idea and want to contribute you can check the <a href="https://nonprofitdevs.com">website</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to contribute on the website itself, you might want to check the <a href="https://github.com/jenaro94/non-profit-devs">repo</a> where it is hosted, it is open source and we already had contributions.</p>
